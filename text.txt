The woman asked me to do my homework about my town.
Hey this is a baseball game.
You can now translate multiple lines without any sort of problems, which is awesome. My whole town is talking about how
you can get punctuation marks done too.

Ant ant ant hey baseball game town homework; yes, I'm writing random words to be translated.
It even corrects words that have incorrect capitalization! Like: AnT, anT, aNT, or aNt. You can even use exclamation
marks, like in: Town! Do you know at what time we need to turn in our baseball homework? Thanks, this woman was very
kind.

Wow man! You can even write in different paragraphs! I'm going to show it to my dog!
